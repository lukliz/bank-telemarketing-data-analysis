# Bank Telemarketing Data Analysis
This project was done during my 2017 spring semester of Business Intelligence class. This is the data analysis of bank telemarketing calls for selling bank long-term deposits of Portugese retail bank. This data includes the time of 2008 financial crisis, which makes the data more interesting.  
  
Main purpose of this analysis is to find out which factor affects customer to deposit, and which month customer deposit the most.  

I used **SSDT(SQL Server Data Tools)** for analyzing the data. Additional analysis are in pdf file (Presentation file).
